# HomeWizard Beta Software Announcements

This repository is used to inform beta users about new beta software updates, including firmware and mobile app versions, and their status. It serves as a central place where beta releases are announced and tracked. Once a beta update is publicly released, its announcement will be closed.

Beta software updates are announced in the [Discussions](https://github.com/homewizard/beta/discussions) section of this repository.
- Only beta software updates are posted.
- When a beta update is released to the public, its announcement will be closed.
- You can use the filter function in Discussions to find closed (released) software updates.
